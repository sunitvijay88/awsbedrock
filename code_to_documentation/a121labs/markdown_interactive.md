This is a Python code for conducting multivariate OLS model and hypothesis testing.
The code contains functions, methods, and classes to perform multivariate OLS analysis. 
The function _multivariate_ols_fit() performs the OLS regression fit using the specified method ('svd' or 'pinv'). 
The function multivariate_stats() is used to compute the test statistics for the hypotheses. 
The function _multivariate_ols_test() performs the hypothesis testing for the specified hypotheses. 
The class _MultivariateOLS() is a model class for conducting multivariate OLS analysis. 
The class _MultivariateOLSResults() is used to store the fitted results and the class MultivariateTestResults() is used to store the hypothesis testing results.
