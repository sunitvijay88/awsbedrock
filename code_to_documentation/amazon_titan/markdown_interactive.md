# Description of Code:
# The provided code consists of multiple functions and classes related to
# multivariate analysis using the `numpy` library and the `statsmodels`
# package. These functions perform statistical tests and calculations for
# multivariate models.


# The `multivariate_stats` function takes various parameters related to eigenvalues,
# residuals, contrasts, and degrees of freedom to compute statistical tests.
# The function calculates values such as `Wilks' lambda`, `Pillai's trace`,
# `Hotelling-Lawley trace`, and `Roy's greatest root` based on the provided
# eigenvalues and residuals. It also calculates `F`-statistics and performs
# significance tests using the provided degrees of freedom.


# The `_multivariate_ols_fit` function performs multivariate ordinary least
# squares (OLS) fitting. It takes `endog` (dependent variable)`, exog` (exogenous
# variables), and optionally a method parameter to specify the fitting
# algorithm. The function calculates regression coefficients and optionally
# covariance matrices.


# The `_multivariate_ols_test` function performs hypothesis testing for a
# multivariate OLS model. It takes a list of hypotheses, the fitted model results,
# exogenous variable names, and endogenous variable names. The function
# generates and returns a dictionary containing the test statistics,
# contrast matrices, and degrees of freedom for each hypothesis.


# The `_MultivariateOLS` class represents a multivariate ordinary least squares
# model. It inherits from the `statsmodels.base.model.Model` class and has an
# initialization method that accepts `endog`, `exog`, and additional keyword
# arguments. The class performs OLS fitting and can be used to estimate and
# perform hypothesis testing on the model.


# The `_MultivariateOLSResults` class is a container for the results of fitting
# and testing a multivariate OLS model. It inherits from the
# `statsmodels.base.model.ModelResults` class and contains attributes for the
# fitted model, exogenous and endogenous variable names, and additional
# information such as the design matrix if the model was fitted with
# `design_info`.


# The `MultivariateTestResults` class is a container for the results of
# multivariate hypothesis testing. It takes the test results dictionary
# generated by `_multivariate_ols_test` and provides methods to access the
# test statistics and contrast matrices for each hypothesis.
