### generated markdown for Python code ###
This code is a Python module that provides the functionality for performing multivariate statistical tests and analyses using the "statsmodels" package and related tools.  Here are some highlights of the code:
import modules:
-The module starts by importing several modules from NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and patsy. These modules provide functions and classes for numerical computations, statistical tests, matrix operations, and generating design information.
definitions and helper functions:
-The module defines several helper functions, including _multivariate_ols_fit() which performs multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation and hypothesis testing using different methods (pinv, svd).
heses simultaneously. These functions calculate the eigenvalues and statistical significance of tests based on the fitted model matrices.-The class _MultivariateOLS represents a multivariate OLS model fit using the specified method. It provides methods for fitting the model, accessing the fitted results, and performing hypothesis testing.Overall, this code provides a suite of functions and classes for performing multivariate statistical analyses using the "statsmodels" and related packages. It enables users to estimate multivariate OLS models, compute statistical measures, and test hypotheses in a flexible and efficient manner.
