 This code implements multivariate OLS regression and hypothesis testing:

- `_multivariate_ols_fit`: Fits multivariate OLS model using SVD or pinv. Returns model parameters, degrees of freedom, covariance matrix, and sum of squares.

- `multivariate_stats`: Calculates multivariate test statistics like Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace etc. and associated p-values. 

- `_multivariate_ols_test`: Performs hypothesis testing on multivariate OLS model.

- `_MultivariateOLS`: Multivariate OLS model class.

- `_MultivariateOLSResults`: Holds results from fitted `_MultivariateOLS` model.

- `mv_test`: Method to perform hypothesis testing on fitted model.

- `MultivariateTestResults`: Class to hold results from mv_test.

- `summary_frame`: Property to return results as multiindex dataframe.

- `summary`: Method to generate model summary with test results.

So in summary, it provides multivariate OLS estimation along with facilities for hypothesis testing and summarizing the results.
