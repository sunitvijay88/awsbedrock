This code performs multivariate regression analysis and hypothesis testing using OLS.

It contains the following classes and functions:

- `_multivariate_ols_fit`: Fits the multivariate OLS model and returns parameter estimates, degrees of freedom, covariance matrix, and residuals sum of squares. It uses either the pseudoinverse or SVD to calculate the estimates.

- `multivariate_stats`: Calculates the multivariate test statistics like Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace etc. and the associated p-values.

- `_multivariate_ols_test`: Performs hypothesis testing on the fitted multivariate OLS results. 

- `_MultivariateOLS`: Model class that inherits from statsmodels and fits the multivariate OLS.

- `_MultivariateOLSResults`: Holds the results of the fitted `_MultivariateOLS` model.

- `MultivariateTestResults`: Returns the results of multivariate hypothesis tests in a clean summary dataframe.

- `mv_test`: Method of `_MultivariateOLSResults` that performs hypothesis testing on the fitted model.

- `summary`: Summarizes the multivariate model fit and test results.

So in summary, it provides an OLS class for multivariate regression, calculates multivariate test statistics and performs hypothesis testing on the fitted multivariate model. The results are returned in a clean summary format.

- PyRunestone, nice summary! Here are some additional key points about the code:

- It handles missing data through the `missing` argument.

- It checks for multicollinearity and singular matrices.

- It allows specifying custom constraints for hypotheses testing through matrices L, M, C. 

- The summary displays the covariance matrix and other diagnostic information.


- Overall it provides a full-featured multivariate OLS regression and hypothesis testing framework with diagnostics.
